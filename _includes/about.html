                <p><font size="4px"> I am a molecular biologist, focused on citrus pathology. I did my bachelor and Ph.D. at the University of La Plata (La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina), and graduated in 2010 and 2015 respectively. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> The main topic of my research at that time was Citrus psorosis and its causal agent, Citrus psorosis virus. I did my first postdoctoral research in the same institution (Maria Laura Garcia lab, Institute of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, IBBM), changing the topic to bacterial diseases of citrus, trying to find alternatives for control of Citrus canker, CVC and Citrus greening (HLB).  </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> In September 2016 I moved to the US, to do my second postdoc in Wenbo Ma lab, University of California Riverside, completely focused on Citrus HLB. </font></p>
